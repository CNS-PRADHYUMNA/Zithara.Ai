# 🚀 Job Board Application

## 📌 Project Summary
We developed a modern, responsive Job Board application using React, TypeScript, and several cutting-edge frontend technologies. The project focuses on creating an intuitive and interactive platform for job seekers and employers.

## 🌐 Live Demo
[Deployed Application](https://zitharajobs.netlify.app/)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Router for navigation
- Zod for form validation
- React Hook Form for form handling
- FontAwesome for icons

## ✅ What's Working?
- **Job Listings:** Dynamic job search and filtering, responsive grid layout, pagination support.
- **Job Details:** Detailed job information display with navigation between listings.
- **Job Posting:** Intuitive job submission form with Zod validation and simulated submission process.
- **Frontend State Management:** Used `useState` for local state management.
- **Mock Data Generation:** Populated job listings with sample data.
- **Responsive UI:** Fully optimized for different screen sizes.

## ❌ What's Missing?
- **Dark Mode:** Not yet implemented.
- **State Management with Zustand/Redux:** Currently using local state, missing a global state management solution.
- **Backend Integration:** The application uses mock data instead of real-time job postings.
- **Authentication & User Management:** No user login, sign-up, or role-based access control.

## 🔧 How Would I Complete It with More Time?
- Implement dark mode using Tailwind CSS.
- Integrate Zustand or Redux for better state management.
- Connect to a backend to allow real-time job postings and applications.
- Add authentication for users and companies, enabling profile management and job tracking.
- Improve UI/UX with more animations and enhanced filtering options.
- Deploy a production-ready version with database and API integration.

This Job Board application serves as a strong foundation for a fully functional job-seeking platform, with potential for future enhancements. 🚀
